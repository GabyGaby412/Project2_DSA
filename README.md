# Project2_DSA
Easiest way to clone this is by running this in terminal of CLion
      git clone link (replace link with git link)
Uses a dataset of 1.6 million tweets acquired from kaggle. 
Beware of githubs file limit making the tokenized dataset have less tweets. Made it so dataset only has part of the tweets (the negative ones).

      
When you run the project it will ask you for a number which will determine how many tweets it will sort.
Must run the project running the graph.
You have to seperately switch your configurations to the python plotting.py so that the graph can display then run it again.
Also run "  python -m ensurepip --upgrade
            python -m pip install --upgrade pip
            python -m pip install pandas matplotlib  "
            with powershell or your terminal so that the python graph can work
Ensure your clion or vcs code has a python interpreter
